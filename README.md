# Project Title
Global Development & Fertility Dynamics.
This project explores how fertility rates vary across countries and how these differences relate to economic and social development indicators.

## Overview

This study analyzes global fertility trends by employing World Bank statistics for each country. We explicitly analyze the relationship between fertility rates in 2018 and GDP per capita, secondary school enrollment, and life expectancy.

This study does not focus on causation; instead, it analyzes overall trends, thresholds, and regional disparities in fertility outcomes among nations.

### Interesting Insight (Optional)

One crucial thing we learnt from our research is that when the economy is bad, fertility rates tend to drop the fastest. Countries with a GDP per person of less than $10,000 have very different birth rates.  In nations with a GDP per capita over this threshold, fertility rates tend to be lower and more uniform.

This pattern shows that the most important changes in fertility behavior happen during the early stages of development. This is a trend that can be seen in many areas.

## Data Sources and Acknowledgements

The World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database is where all the data for this project came from.  The WDI R package in R was used to get to the data.

The project uses public indicators for each country, such as life expectancy, GDP per capita, fertility rate, and secondary school enrollment.  We thank the World Bank for making these datasets available to everyone for study and teaching.

## Current Plan

The primary objective of this project is to enhance understanding of the temporal variations in global fertility rates through data analysis and visualization. We look at how birth rates are related to measures of social and economic well-being, as well as how these relationships change from place to place.
Today, the focus is on figuring out what the rules and patterns are, not on saying what causes things.
